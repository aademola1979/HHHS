          Following the vision of
          our  <span className="font-bold">Executive Director, Rev. Eze, </span> 
          who envisioned estblishing a
          school with world-class facilities, we were established in 1993.
          The school operates on national and international policies on education with 
          comprehensive curricula that cover all relevant secondary school subjects. 
          This provides the students with a broad opportunity to choose and achieve full
          academic potential to compete with the brightest and best among their
          peers both in Nigeria and beyond. This menifests in the excellent performance 
          of our students in external examinations such as <span className="font-bold">SSCE, IGCSE, NECO, IELTS, SAT, TOEFL, etc. </span> 
          We have also excelled in inter-school competitions.
